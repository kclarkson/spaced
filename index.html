        The Symposium for Part-time, Adjunct, and Contingent Educators (SPACE) is a conference where part-time, adjunct, and contingent faculty can present their original scholarship in a peer-reviewed, professional setting. SPACE also provides a venue for contingent faculty members to share what they are doing in the classroom and to connect with their contingent colleagues. 
      </p>
       </div>


      <h2 class="sub-header">Why have Space?</h2>
      <div class="row large-10">
        <p>
        In the past year, public interest regarding the over 1.3 million part-time and contingent faculty teaching in U.S. higher education has rapidly increased.  With this increased visibility, the rest of the world is learning what contingent faculty already knew—these “hired guns” of higher ed are every bit as serious and capable as their full-time counterparts. Institutional support for contingent faculty professional development varies widely, though. SPACE is a place where contingent faculty members are highlighted for their achievements in scholarship and teaching.
      </p>
      </div>

    
 
      <h2 class="sub-header">Who should come to Space?</h2>
      <p class="row large-10">
        SPACE was created to provide opportunities for contingent faculty to present at a peer-reviewed conference. We welcome submissions and attendance from part-time faculty, Full-time Limited Term faculty, adjunct faculty, sessional faculty, post-doctoral faculty, visiting faculty, etc. Whatever the title, if your position within higher education is uncertain from semester-to-semester, depends on enrollment or other institutional factors beyond your control, or is limited to a term of less than 2 years, you are encouraged to submit a proposal.
